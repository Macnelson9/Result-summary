## Overview

Well, this challenge proved to be quite technical as it involves some JavaScript, but generally it is an okay challenge for anyone who is just starting out as a frontend developer.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process

I observed the design image before I began the challenge and I figured that two cards are involved, that is; the left and the right cards. I then created two containers to hold each card, while also displaying the body of the page as flex, so it centers the items right in the middle of the page. For the left hand container, I put a display flex on it as well as on the right hand container. And I made the flex direction column so that all items in each container will stack on top of each other. Then on the right container, there are items each with an image, text, space between and then number result. So I created a div for each of those and did a displa flex on them with the default flex direction set on it. Meaning they sit side by side, and then I gave them a flex gap to create a space between and then used padding to move the last item to the end of the flex container. And then I did the basic styling to each container and card. I hope you find this helpful i your projects. You can contact me for more clarification. Happy coding!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Didn't really learn much as I wasn't able to implement using the data.json file. But I'm glad I pulled it off regardless.

### Continued development

I would learn to write codes using JavaScript and I might come back to implement the data.json file in this project.
